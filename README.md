# Paper Tablet

In short, the purpose of this project is to detect a sheet of paper in an image, compute the
transformation between the paper and the camera, correct the perspective and generate an image as if
the camera was viewing the paper from the top. Furthermore, the output image must be cropped
showing nothing else than the paper.
